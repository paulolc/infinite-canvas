# TODO ðŸš§

- DONE - Zoom
- DONE - Translate (Drag)
- DONE - Sync Scale Canvas with Infinite Canvas I
- DONE - Decimal scale units Years<->Decades
- DONE - Content: PT Kings
- DONE - Content: PT Presidents
- Crosshairs
- Grid - extend scale ticks across the canvas
- Zoom Split - Capability to do just do Horizontal (time) Zoom. Timeline compresses but images, markers, text, etc stay at the same size.
- Time Record Lock to the top/side if start or end become outside the display
- Centuries - Decimal scale "macro" units 
- Kyrs (1000's) - Decimal scale "macro" units 
- Gyrs (max Billion Years) - Decimal scale "macro" units 
- Automatic Layout 
    - Horizontal Zoom OUT -> Break timeline alignment and rearrange timeline records to avoid overlap   
    - Horizontal Zoom  IN -> Align timeline records to show continuity of timelines 
- Time Records MAXIMUM and MINIMUM zoom 
- Time Records SHOW and HIDE zoom levels
- Time Records with Different Card Layouts depending on Zoom Level ( More Zoom -> More infomation, Less Zoom -> Information summarized and compressed)
- Time Records priority/importance
- Non-Decimal scale units Months<->Weeks
- Non-Decimal "small" scale units: Days<->Hours<->Minutes<->Seconds
- Decimal scale "micro" units microseconds<->milliseconds<->nanoseconds<->picoseconds<->10^(-n)<->Planck Time
- Time records DB


FUTURE:
- Filter time records
- Group related timeline records within lanes (by Country, by Civilization, by Continent, etc)
- Make those lanes collapsible 
- UI to add time records
- Datasets - Set of related time records (PT-Presidents, PT-Kings)
- Public/Private "Datasets"
- Vote on public Datasets
- Featured
- Personal/Custom data
- Authentication
